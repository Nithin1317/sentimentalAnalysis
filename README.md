Description:

The project uses a Twitter dataset from Kaggle to analyze sentiment in social media text data using a Naive Bayes classification algorithm. After training on the Twitter dataset, the model is imported into a Django project. The model is implemented using a web page built using Django, and its accuracy rate is 85%, offering a reasonable estimate of sentiment. This Django-based platform is a useful tool for users as it minimizes the time and effort needed for sentiment analysis in large volumes of social media material.
